📱 Exploring Global Fitness Trends with Power BI! 💪📊
 Thrilled to share my latest Power BI dashboard project — a deep dive into user behavior and subscription trends of a Fitness App dataset! 🧘‍♀️📈
🔍 What I Explored:
 Using a rich dataset containing user profiles, workouts, subscription types, countries, and revenue data, I created an interactive dashboard that reveals key insights such as:

📊 Key Highlights of the Dashboard:
 🔹 Total Users Analysis – Breakdown of total, paid, and free users
 🔹 Gender Distribution – Visualized with donut chart (Male vs Female ⚖️)
 🔹 Subscription Trends – Comparison of Monthly, Quarterly, and Annual plans 📅
 🔹 Country-Wise User Base – Which countries use the app the most 🌎
 🔹 Workout Type Preferences – Most loved workouts by users 💪🧘‍♀️
 🔹 Revenue Insights – Total revenue by subscription type 💵
 🔹 ARPPU (Avg. Revenue per Paid User) – Key business metric 📈
 🔹 User Activity & BMI Averages – Fitness behavior & health tracking 🔍

📐 Skills & Tools Used:
 🛠️ Power BI for visualization & reporting
 📊 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for dynamic measures
 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation in Power Query
 📈 Visual Elements: Card visuals, Pie & Bar charts, Line graphs, Matrix tables
 🎛️ Filters/Slicers: Subscription Type, Country, Workout Type for interactivity

📌 What I Learned:
 ✨ How to create a story with data using visuals
 ✨ The power of filters and slicers in interactive dashboards
